- [x] To start this programm check the fist lines of the programm and update the ip address and login-password of your router. Then just type in command line
```
python get_signal3g.py 
```

Please note, some users may experience problems (inappropriate signal strength that is not changing) - this is due to the different outputs in the "comgt" function. Please adjust the line 20 playing with the numbers in brackets [15:17], [16:19] and so on.
